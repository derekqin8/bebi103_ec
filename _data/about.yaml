  Analysis of Microtubule Catastrophe Times

Abstract: >
  Microtubule polymerization and catastrophe are biologically significant events
  that are directly related to cell growth regulation, organization of the
  intracellular space, organelle transport, and chromosome segregation, among
  many other biological processes. Understanding the breakdown of these
  structural units is important in learning about the biophysics of the cell.
  In the [2011 *Cell* paper by Gardner, et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867411012876?via%3Dihub),
  they quantified microtubule catastrophe events at different tubulin
  concentrations using time-wise fluroscence imaging of labeled and unlabeled
  tubulin. These images were previously analyzed to produce quantitative data
  about microtubule catastrophe times. Using various techniques taught in
  BE/Bi 103a, two theoretical models for the catastrophe times were assessed
  against this data set: Gamma distribution and a two-Poisson process model.
  Using the least squares method for maximum likelihood estimates (MLE),
  visualizations such as Q-Q plots and predictive ECDFs, and the Akaike weight
  numerical indicator for model assessment, we found that a Gamma distribution
  theoretical model was better suited for predicting microtubule catastrophe
  times. By the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ MLEs obtained for various tubulin
  concentrations according to the Gamma distribution, we infer that the
  concentration of tubulin is positively correlated with the microtubule
  catastrophe times.
